# ADR 1: Record architecture decisions

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to record the architectural decisions made in this project to ensure clarity and traceability as the system evolves.

## Decision
We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), stored in the `doc/adr/` directory, to document key decisions.

## Consequences
All significant architectural decisions will be captured in ADRs, making it easier for contributors to understand the rationale behind the system's structure and changes over time.
