# ADR 3: Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Strict Test-First Adherence

## Status
Accepted

## Context
To ensure high code quality, maintainability, and confidence in changes, we want to enforce a strict test-first workflow.

## Decision
All new functionality must be developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD). Tests must be written before production code. Code reviews will enforce this rule.

## Consequences
- Improved test coverage and reliability
- Reduced regression risk
- Slower initial development, but faster debugging and safer refactoring
