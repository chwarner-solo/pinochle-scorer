# ADR 2: Use Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The project is organized around core domain concepts such as Game, Hand, Player, and Team, with clear separation between domain, application, and infrastructure layers.

## Decision
We will follow Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles, structuring code by domain concepts and enforcing boundaries between layers.

## Consequences
This approach improves maintainability, testability, and clarity, and supports future growth of the codebase.
