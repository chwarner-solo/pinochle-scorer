# ADR 5: Front End Stack: Vite + React + TypeScript + Material UI

## Status
Superseded by ADR 0008

## Context
We want a modern, maintainable, and performant front end that integrates well with the backend and is easy for developers to contribute to.

## Decision
The front end will use:
- Vite for fast development and build tooling
- React for UI components
- TypeScript for type safety
- Material UI for consistent, professional design

## Consequences
- Fast iteration and modern developer experience
- Consistent, accessible UI
- Easy onboarding for new developers familiar with React
